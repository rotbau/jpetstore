# Modern Pets Visual Search Interface

A microservice that extends the JPetStore application with a Messaging interface that leverages TensorFlow(https://www.tensorflow.org) to add visual search capabilities to the JPetStore. This microservice uses Twilio to enable MMS text messages to the JPetStore. Simply text a photo of a pet and see what is available.
